Q.9
Aim: Create and run a job in Jenkins for simple HelloWorld in Java using a version control 
tool.

Steps:
Update ubuntu repository
1. su root
2. apt-get update

Install Java development kit 
3. apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk

To test if Java has been installed successfully, run this command: 
4. java --version

Install Jenkins
5. curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo tee \ 
  /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null

6. echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \ 
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \ 
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null

7. sudo apt-get update 
8. sudo apt-get install jenkins 

To check Jenkins installed or not: 
9. jenkins --version

Once that’s done, start the Jenkins service with the following command: 
10.sudo systemctl start jenkins.service
Press ctrl+z to exit

Adjust Firewall and Configuring Jenkins
11. sudo ufw status
12. sudo ufw allow 8080
13. sudo ufw enable
14. sudo ufw status

With the firewall configured, it’s time to set up Jenkins itself. 
Once installation is done, you can test the application on http://localhost:8080 in browser OR  http://127.0.0.1:8080
Type in the IP of your VPS along with the port number. The Jenkins setup 
wizard will be shown.

An administrator password will be needed to proceed with the configuration. It can be 
easily found inside the /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword file.
15. cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
Copy the password, go back to the setup wizard, paste it and click Continue. 

Customize Jenkins window will appear. We recommend simply selecting the Install suggested plugins option for this step.
16. Click on Install Suggested Plugins 

Give it a couple of minutes for the installation process to complete. Once it’s done, specify your username, password, full name, and email address, and click on Save and Continue to create an admin user. 

Then specify the preferred Jenkins URL and finish the configuration process.

After configuration, the Jenkins dashboard will appear, meaning the Jenkins server installation and initial setup were successful. 

Jenkins Programming in Java using Version Control Git:
17. Go to the Jenkins dashboard and click on the New Item. 
18. In the next page, enter the item name, and select the 'Freestyle project' option. And click OK. Here, my item name is HelloWorld. 
19. When you enter the OK, you will get a configuration page. Enter the details of the project in the Description section. 
20. On the Source Code Management section, select the Git option, and specify the Repository URL. 

First, you have to create a project in java. Here, I created a simple HelloWorld program 
and saved it to one folder i.e. Desktop/JENKINS_LAB. Compile the HelloWorld.java file. 
21. cd JENKINS_LAB/
22. gedit Simple.java
23. javac Simple.java
24. java Simple

Now create a project in your GitHub account and give the Repository name. Here my repository name is HelloWorld_29072024.
25. Click on Create repository.

Your repository is created. Copy the repository URL. My repository URL is:
Open the command prompt in your Ubuntu and go to the path where your java file is 
created.
26. git init
27. git status
28. git add .
29. git status

Configure your GitHub account in your system. 
30. git config --global user.email "your@email"   
31. git config --global user.name "username"  

Commit it and add the repository URL.
32. git commit -m "Added HelloWorld Java Program"  
33. git remote add origin <URL of your Repo>
34. git push -u origin main 
35. git remote set-url origin <URL>
36. git push -u origin main

Now, when you refresh your GitHub account, the HelloWorld file will be added in your 
repository.
Add the Repository URL in the Source Code Management section on Jenkins.
37. <URL>

38. Now, it is time to build the code. Click on "Add build step" and select the "Execute 
Shell".

Enter the following command to compile the java code. 
39. javac Simple.java   
40. java Simple

41. Click Apply and then Save button.
42. Once you saved the configuration, then now can click on Build Now option
43. After clicking on Build Now, you can see the status of the build on the Build History 
section.
44. Click on the build number #2 in the Build History section to see the details of the build. 

Click on Console Output from the left side of the screen to see the status of the build 
you run. It should show the success message.
