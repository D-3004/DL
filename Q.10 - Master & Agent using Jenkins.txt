Step 1: Prepare (Terminal)
# Update system and install Java
sudo apt update && sudo apt install default-jdk -y

# Create Agent Directory (replace 'ubuntu' with your username)
mkdir -p /home/ubuntu/jenkins-agent-work

Step 2: Configure Jenkins (Web UI)
Go to Manage Jenkins → Nodes → New Node
Name: local-agent
Select Permanent Agent → Click Create
Remote root directory: /home/ubuntu/jenkins-agent-work
Labels: local-agent
Launch method: Launch agent via execution of command on the controller
(Install plugin “Command Agent Launcher” if not already installed)
Click Save

Step 3: Download and Prepare Agent Files (Terminal)
# Download agent.jar into Jenkins home directory
sudo wget http://localhost:8080/jnlpJars/agent.jar -O /root/.jenkins/agent.jar
In Jenkins web UI, go to Manage Jenkins → Nodes → local-agent
Copy the secret key displayed on that page
Create a secret file with that key:
sudo bash -c 'echo "PASTE_YOUR_LONG_SECRET_KEY_HERE" > /root/.jenkins/agent-secret'

Step 4: Set Launch Command in Jenkins (Web UI)
Go to Manage Jenkins → Nodes → local-agent → Configure
In the Command box, paste this:
java -jar /root/.jenkins/agent.jar -jnlpUrl http://localhost:8080/computer/local-agent/jenkins-agent.jnlp -secret @/root/.jenkins/agent-secret -workDir /home/ubuntu/jenkins-agent-work

Click Save

Step 5: Launch Agent (Web UI
Go to Manage Jenkins → Nodes
Click local-agent
Click Launch agent
Wait a few seconds and refresh the page
The status should show Connected / Online

Step 6: Create and Run Test Job (Web UI)
Go to Dashboard → New Item
Name: LocalAgentTest → select Freestyle project → Click OK
Under General, check Restrict where this project can be run
Label Expression: local-agent
Under Build Steps, click Add build step → Execute shell
Command:

echo "Hello from Local Agent!"

Click Apply → Save
Click Build Now

Step 7: Verify Output
Go to Build History → #1 → Console Output
Confirm it shows:
Running on local-agent
Hello from Local Agent!
Finished: SUCCESS





OR







10. Jenkins Master & Agent 
Step 1: Prepare (Terminal)
Bash

# Install Java (if not already)
sudo apt update && sudo apt install default-jdk -y

# Create Agent Directory (use your username)
mkdir -p /home/ubuntu/jenkins-agent-work  --change ubuntu with your user name
Step 2: Configure Jenkins (Web UI)
Go to Manage Jenkins → Nodes → New Node.

Name: local-agent.

Select Permanent Agent. Click Create.

Remote root directory: /home/ubuntu/jenkins-agent-work.

Labels: local-agent.

Launch method: Launch agent via execution of command on the controller.  for this we need to install plugin that is "Command Agent Launcher"

Save.

Step 3: Launch Agent (Web UI)
Go to Manage Jenkins → Nodes.

Click local-agent.

Click Launch agent.

(Wait a few seconds, refresh Nodes page to see connection).

Step 4: Create & Run Test Job (Web UI)
Go to Dashboard → New Item.

Name: LocalAgentTest, select Freestyle project, click OK.

General Tab:

Check Restrict where this project can be run.

Label Expression: local-agent.

Build Steps Tab:

Add build step → Execute shell.

Command: echo "Hello from Local Agent!".

Apply → Save.

Build Now.

Step 5: Verify (Web UI)
Go to Build History → #1 → Console Output.

Look for Running on local-agent... and Hello from Local Agent!.

Look for Finished: SUCCESS.


for generating launch command we need to do this

Here is the command you need.

However, based on the logs you sent, your Jenkins setup is **running as the `root` user** (your Jenkins home is `/root/.jenkins/`). This changes where you should store your agent files.

Please follow these **exact steps**.

### **Step 1: Download `agent.jar` to your Jenkins Home**

Run this command **on your server (codee-VirtualBox)** to download the agent file into the *correct* directory that your Jenkins setup is using.

```bash
# This downloads the agent.jar file into your /root/.jenkins/ directory
sudo wget http://localhost:8080/jnlpJars/agent.jar -O /root/.jenkins/agent.jar
```

### **Step 2: Create the Secret File in your Jenkins Home**

1.  In your Jenkins web browser, go to **Manage Jenkins** → **Nodes** → click your agent's name (e.g., `local-agent`).
2.  You will see a long secret key on the page. Copy that key.
3.  Run this command **on your server**, pasting your secret key inside the quotes:

<!-- end list -->

```bash
# This creates the secret file in the correct directory
sudo bash -c 'echo "PASTE_YOUR_LONG_SECRET_KEY_HERE" > /root/.jenkins/agent-secret'
```

### **Step 3: Your Final Launch Command**

Now, go back to your Jenkins agent configuration page:
**Manage Jenkins** → **Nodes** → **local-agent** → **Configure**

In the **`Command`** text box, paste this **exact command**:

```bash
java -jar /root/.jenkins/agent.jar -jnlpUrl http://localhost:8080/computer/local-agent/jenkins-agent.jnlp -secret @/root/.jenkins/agent-secret -workDir /home/codee/jenkins-agent-work
```

-----

### **Final Checklist (If it Fails)**

If the agent still won't connect, check these two things:

1.  **Is your Node Name `local-agent`?**
    In the command above, the URL has `/computer/local-agent/`. If you named your node something different (like `my-agent`), you **must** change the URL to match it.
    *Example:* `/computer/my-agent/jenkins-agent.jnlp`

2.  **Does `/home/codee/jenkins-agent-work` exist?**
    The command will try to use this folder. Let's make sure it exists first.

    ```bash
    # Run this on your server to create the directory
    mkdir -p /home/codee/jenkins-agent-work
    ```

After saving the configuration with the new command, click **"Bring this agent back online"** (or "Disconnect" then "Launch agent") on the agent's status page to make Jenkins try again.
