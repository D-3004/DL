🧩 CI/CD Pipeline Simulation Steps

(Perform all steps in your local terminal)

Step 1: Create Project Folders

📂 You’ll create everything inside your Desktop for simplicity.

cd ~/Desktop
mkdir cicd-demo
cd cicd-demo


Now create the folders inside this project:
mkdir app
mkdir staging_server
mkdir production_server


✅ Folder structure will look like this:

Desktop/
 └── cicd-demo/
     ├── app/
     ├── staging_server/
     └── production_server/

Step 2: Create Application File
Now create your application file inside the app folder:
gedit app/index.html

Paste the following code and save the file (Ctrl + S → Close editor):

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>CICD Demo</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>App Version 1.0</h1>
<p>This page was deployed by a CICD pipeline.</p>
</body>
</html>

Step 3: Create Continuous Delivery Script
📄 Create the script inside the same main folder (cicd-demo):
gedit pipeline_continuous_delivery.sh

Paste the following content and save:

#!/bin/bash

echo "PIPELINE STARTED..."
echo "Step 1: Running build (simulated)..."
sleep 1

echo "Step 2: Running tests (simulated)..."
sleep 1
echo "CI TESTS PASSED!"
echo "---------------------------------"

echo "Step 3: Deploying to Staging Server..."
cp app/index.html staging_server/
echo "DEPLOYED to staging_server/"
echo "---------------------------------"

echo "Ready for Production."
read -p "Press [Enter] to approve deployment to PRODUCTION..."

echo "Step 4: Deploying to Production Server..."
cp app/index.html production_server/
echo "---------------------------------"
echo "PIPELINE FINISHED. Deployed to Production."


Step 4: Make the Script Executable
Run this inside the cicd-demo folder:

chmod +x pipeline_continuous_delivery.sh


Step 5: Run Continuous Delivery Pipeline
Still inside cicd-demo, run:

./pipeline_continuous_delivery.sh

When you see this prompt:

Ready for Production.
Press [Enter] to approve deployment to PRODUCTION...
Press Enter to continue.
Then verify the result:

cat production_server/index.html
✅ You should see your HTML content.


Step 6: Create Continuous Deployment Script
📄 Copy your previous script and edit it (inside same cicd-demo folder):

cp pipeline_continuous_delivery.sh pipeline_continuous_deployment.sh
gedit pipeline_continuous_deployment.sh

Delete these two lines (the manual approval step):

echo "Ready for Production."
read -p "Press [Enter] to approve deployment to PRODUCTION..."

Save and close the file.


Step 7: Prepare Production Server for Testing
To see the change after auto-deployment, first replace production file with fake data:
echo "This is the old, broken version" > production_server/index.html


Step 8: Run Continuous Deployment Pipeline
Now run the automatic pipeline:

./pipeline_continuous_deployment.sh

Then verify:

cat production_server/index.html


✅ You should now see the updated HTML content automatically deployed


View in Browser (Visual Check)

If you want to see it like a web page:

Open your file explorer.

Go to the project folder you created (example: Desktop/cicd-demo/production_server/).

Double-click on index.html.

It will open in your browser and show:
“App Version 1.0 — This page was deployed by a CICD pipeline.”
